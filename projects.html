<h4>ServiceNow_GRC_Project4</h4>
<p>Advanced GRC automation designed to streamline policy, control, and compliance workflows across the enterprise.</p>

<details class='proj'><summary>View Full Details</summary>
<div class='proj-points'>

<h4>Industry Positioning</h4>
<p>This project enhances enterprise compliance operations by automating policy updates, control testing, and audit readiness for regulated industries.</p>

<h4>Technical Architecture</h4>
<p>Built using Policy & Compliance, Risk, and Audit modules with Flow Designer, scripted logic, evidence tasks, and configurable indicators for continuous monitoring.</p>

<h4>Business Problem</h4>
<p>Manual policy mapping and control testing lead to slow compliance processes, inconsistent documentation, and audit delays.</p>

<h4>AI Hypothesis</h4>
<p>AI-driven monitoring can identify policy/control deviations early and recommend corrective actions before compliance risks materialize.</p>

<h4>Solution Prototype</h4>
<p>Implemented workflows for automated control testing, evidence collection, and compliance dashboards with structured approval gates.</p>
